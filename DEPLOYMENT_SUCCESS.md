## Test the Bug Fix

### Test Scenario 1: Fresh Load

2. Then open student login in another tab
3. Join as a student with any name
4. ✨ **Student card should appear immediately** (no refresh!)

### Test Scenario 2: Multiple Students
1. Keep teacher dashboard open
2. Have 2-3 students join
3. All cards should appear in real-time

### Test Scenario 3: Reconnection
1. Have a student join
2. Close student tab completely
3. Rejoin with same name
4. Card should update (not duplicate)

---

## New Debug Features

The deployment includes enhanced logging. Open browser console to see:

### Teacher Dashboard Console
```
📥 Loading X existing members from presence
👤 Presence enter event: { studentName, clientId, studentId }
✅ Added new student: { ... }
📊 Total students after add: X
```

### Student Console
```
✅ Student connected to Ably
✅ Re-entered presence as: [name] with studentId: [id]
```

These logs help debug any future connection issues.

- Build size: Same (~1MB gzipped)
- Load time: No change
- Memory usage: Normal (59.6 MB)
- The logging is lightweight and only in console
