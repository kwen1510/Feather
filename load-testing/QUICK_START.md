# Quick Start - Load Testing

## 3-Minute Setup

### 1. Install

```bash
cd /Users/etdadmin/Desktop/Ably/load-testing
npm install
```

### 2. Configure

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` to set:
- `NUM_STUDENTS` - How many students to simulate (default: 10)
- `TOKEN_SERVER_URL` - Your server URL

**For local testing:**
```env
TOKEN_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/api/token
```

**For production testing:**
```env
TOKEN_SERVER_URL=http://146.190.100.142/api/token
```

### 3. Run

```bash
npm start
```

## Watch It Live!

While the test runs, open your whiteboard app:

1. Go to `http://146.190.100.142` (or your server URL)
2. Enter room code: `load-test-room`
3. Choose "Teacher" or "Student"
4. **Watch random strokes appear from all simulated students!**

## Quick Tests

```bash
# Test with 5 students
NUM_STUDENTS=5 npm start

# Test with 50 students for 2 minutes
NUM_STUDENTS=50 TEST_DURATION_SECONDS=120 npm start

# Stress test: 100 students drawing every second
NUM_STUDENTS=100 DRAW_INTERVAL_MS=1000 npm start
```
